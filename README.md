# compressPGM
compress PGM  - Andvanced programing in C project
This project was made for the curse Advanced Programing in C at MTA (The Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yaffo) with the guidence of Dr. Alon Schclar.
The program will read a PGM image and compress it with a simpale grey segment shrinking algorim.
The result will be a compressed binary PGM file.

there is a pdf file explaining the assinments of the project in hebrew. Will translate it if i will have time.
Note that the code uses only very basic data stractures and very basic trival algoritmes that are not efficient.
best to run on a linux environment (the is a makefile attached and a pgm image of Lena)
